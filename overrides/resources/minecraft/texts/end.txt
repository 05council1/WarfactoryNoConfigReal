Trainvoi stepped out of the taxi and took his first breath of the dense tropical air. Was this the place? 


He checked his invitation again. 101 Catspaw Lane, Miami Florida. 


Damn Sailor, Trainvoi thought. Sending him all the way here from Vietnam, and for what? 


Sailor's message was a cryptic one, only ":3" followed by an address and a plane ticket. 


Nevertheless, he took the whole flight there, and trudged along through the Florida streets to here.


Trainvoi sighed, already exhausted from jetlag. Only 100 days here, right? Shouldn't be that bad. Trainvoi fumbled with his copy of the keys and placed his hand on the doorknob. No turning back now.


Begrudgingly, he opened the door. 


"Reimu Touhou?!" he gasped.
