Depth: 0-200 meters. Permeating the audio clip was the sound of droplets, echoing footsteps and the occasional shifting of rocks.

Nothing notable has yet been found.


Lrdmtns: Skibidi dop dop dop yes yes


Trainvoi: so real


Fyrsti: Where are we anyways?


Cory: idk it's too dark to see. Anyone got a flashlight?


A rustling sound can be heard, followed a click.


Mapper: here it is


Nemo: Holy shit! Watch it!


Veko: Safety's on :troll:


Sailor: We're supposed to find Agartha in here? It's literally just a cave.


Mapper: I think it's that way. In the pit.


Fyrsti: Alright. Let's get this over wi-


A horrifying roar echoes through the cavern. Audio analysis suggests the sound originated deeper in.


Fyrsti: ... How much were we paid for this again?


Vodq: I don't know. Like a million?


Nemo: A million what?


Vodq: Zimbabwe Dollar


Depth: 3000 meters. The sound of a strong wind obscures the conversation.

The team has located the opening of a massive vertical shaft, roughly 400 meters in radius and of unknown depth. Light and heat, of a strength identical to daylight, appears to emanate from the bottom.


Trainvoi: looks deep.


Fyrsti: I think I see birds down there!


Ldrmtns: those aren't birds. They look scaley. Kinda like.. pterodactyls.


Mapper: Agartha's at the bottom of this. I can feel it. I can feel the Agarthan spirit calling to me.


Nemo: The shaft's like a billion kilometers deep and wider than the eye of London. Even if it is, how tf are we getting down there?


Mapper: we have rapelling tools.


Cory: That'll only take us down 500 meters, at most.


Fyrsti: Pass me the grappling hooks. I have an idea.


Nemo: You'll die trying that.


Vodq: Let the man cook.


Fyrsti: I think I can hit those outcroppings. The hooks are rated to carry all of us, so we can probably go down 500 meters at a time. Hit one with the hook, travel to it, then hit another.


Depth: 14,000 meters. Voices are difficult to hear over the sounds of insects buzzing and birdsong. The audio log has been filtered for ease of listening.

The area is reminiscent of a rainforest. Flora and fauna appears drastically diverged from aboveground species.


Mapper: Holy SHIT those are some big-ass mushrooms. Can I eat them?


Nemo: You'll trip balls and die.


Mapper: You’re not exactly helping with the temptation.


Fyrsti: Where are we anyways?


Cory: I'm guessing it's some weird kind of rainforest. The ceiling is high enough to be tinted blue, like sky, almost. There's clouds too. That means a full water cycle. Enough heat and light to match broad daylight, but I think it's coming from below. The entire cavern seems to tilt downwards, towards it.


Nemo: I'm in awe of this place. Bloody hell! Look at the sky! It's a whole soddin' forest underground! Trees and all!


Lrdmtns: I hate this place. It's terrifying.


Vodq: Tell em about the squirrel.


Nemo: Yeah the animals down here are all kinds of fucked up. They're too big. There was this bear thing... but it wasn't a bear. More like a gecko, but also bear-sized, but bigger.


Fyrsti: Lizard bear.


Nemo: Yeah. Lizard bear. And the squirrel too. Big enough to gnaw my head off. Had the teeth to do it too.


Depth: 30,000 meters. The team is approaching the Mohorovičić discontinuity. The environment appears to be habitable, as the buzzing of flies can be heard in the background.



Fyrsti: Mushroom.


Nemo: Mushroom.


Cory: Mushroom.


Sailor: Mushroom.


Mapper: Mushroom.


Lrdmtns: Mushroom.


Vodq: Mushroom.


Trainvoi: mushroom.


[All Together]: Mushroom. Mushroom. Mushroom. Mushroom.


Mushroom: Mushroom.


Depth: 36,000 meters. The faint echo of wind can be heard amidst the clicking of crickets.


Cory: Too many bones around here.


Trainvoi: Look. Ribs.


Nemo: Those are literally the size of skyscrapers. They're too big to be ribs.


Sailor: Guys? You might want to have a look at this.


Lrdmtns: GUYS! I found something!


Vodq: What?


Lrdmtns: It's a skull! I think it's human.


Mapper: Something's wrong. I can tell by the... vibes.


Fyrsti: I think it's trying to bite you.


Lrdmtns: how? It's dead.


Fyrsti: Not as dead as you'd think.


Mapper: This must be where the Agarthans banished their dead. Their undead.


Fyrsti: That's a problem.


Note: The sound of rattling bones and, oddly, marimba music, becomes noticeable at this time, soon reaching a fierce crescendo.


Nemo: There's millions of 'em all around us.


Sailor: How many mags do you have left?


Mapper: Enough.


Sailor: Good. We'll need them all.


Nemo: One small problem though. How are we gonna kill 'em if they're already dead?


Depth: 42,000m. The sound of strong wind and ice crystals permeates the audio clip. Voices are barely audible.


Vodq: Shiit this place sucks. It's like if you turned a mountain inside out.


Nemo: I literally can't feel my legs.


Sailor: It's like that one spongebob episode - you know the one. Where Sandy got, like, fat? And was hibernating or something? Idk. It's like that; I can use the icicles on my face as chopsticks.


Cory: Still warmer than home though.


Mapper: Real.


Vodq: My feet hurt :(


Trainvoi: FEET?!?!?!?! Shqsdiahfeiohwqeiufhihdioqwjojpaehoieathj


Fyrsti: Guys? Problem up ahead!


Sailor: More skeletons?


Fyrsti: No. Worse.


Sailor: What could be worse tha-


Note: Sailor ascended the "peak" of the subterranean mountain at that moment.


Sailor: Yep. That's worse.


Fyrsti: Which do we choose?


Note: Photos of the area show two branching tunnels, each a kilometer in radius, stretching out in roughly the same direction.


Fyrsti: Are those trees on the right?


Sailor: Not like any trees I've seen.


Vodq: What's to the left?


Sailor: The left looks like more snow. It's kinda dark too.


Vodq: Hell no. Right. Go right!


Depth: 47,000m. Unidentifiable animal noises and the sloshing of water can be heard in the background.


Vodq: Man, we should've gone left. This place sucks too.


Nemo: My brother in Christ you chose this path.


Cory: How are these trees even growing here? Look at the soil; pure salt. Tastes like it too.


Sailor: Maybe don't eat the ground.


Nemo: Descending's a pain here too. It's the brine pools: they're all terraced like rice paddies.


Vodq: Hey has anyone seen Lrdmtns?


Trainvoi: Not since the wasp nest.


[In Unison]: Oh shit!


Fyrsti: Found him!


Note: A recovered photo is included. It is hastily-shot, but shows Lrdmtns being chased by a swarm of cat-sized wasps.


Lrdmtns: Help me! Oh God! Help me!!


Mapper: I warned you! You shouldn't have shot at them!


Lrdmtns: [bloodcurdling screams]


Note: Several gunshots, buzzing and eventually a splash is heard. It is believed that Mtns was lifted into the air by the swarm, stung, and dropped into a brine pool.


Vodq: Oh my God they killed Mtns!!


Trainvoi: Bruh.


Depth: 50,000m. The sound of waves, seagulls and unidentified animals can be heard.


Mapper: What do you think? Ocean or river?


Sailor: It's salty. And big.


Nemo: lol like your mum.


Mapper: Shut up. Anyways, it's like ocean water and ocean depth, but it's all flowing at once like a river.


Fyrsti: Guys! I've got the boat kit unpacked!


Vodq: I call captain!


Fyrsti: Fine :(


Note: The next 30 minutes of audio are taken up by numerous attempts to build the boat. Some mild profanity can be heard occasionally when a step is followed incorrectly.


Cory: We should name this river.


Mapper: Any ideas?


Cory: Let's call it the River Styx.


Sailor: Wait. Wait. Wait. Holy Shit. Is that an ULTRAKILL reference???????


Trainvoi: No.


Sailor: ULTRAKILL IS THE BEST FUCKING GAME 🔥🔥🔥🔥💯💯💯💯 MINOS PRIME IS SO BADASSSSSSSSS 😎😎😎😎😎😎😎👊👊👊👊👊 JUDJEMENT. DIE. CRUSH. THY END IS NOW 😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩 😩😩😩😩I AM GOING TO ULTRAKILL YOU MAY THY VOWS BE MANY AND THY DAYS FEW Machine, turn back no-


Depth: >100,000m. Note: The first 30 minutes of this audiolog are all sea shanties. Those have been cut out for brevity.

Cory: Ahoy me hearties! Be there land on there horizon?


Trainvoi: Stop


Cory: I be the captain while Vodq's o'erboard! Assume yer post and keep yer mouth shut, scallywag!


Fyrsti: Word of warning - don't look under the water.


Sailor: Why?


Fyrsti: Remember that giant ribcage? I think I figured out what it belongs to.


Mapper: I'm gonna reel in Vodq.


Note: the sound of pulleys can be heard.


Trainvoi: You catch anything?


Vodq: Just this one thing. It's like a catfish. I think it's edible.


Nemo: Captain! Look!


Cory and Vodq in unison: What?


Nemo: It goes down! DOWN!!


Cory: Lemme see for myself! You're just trying to scar-


Cory: It do. Retract the sails! Seal the hatches!


Mapper: It gets worse. See those towers?


Nemo: Yeah. The slimy ones?


Mapper: Those aren't towers.


Nemo: What are they then?


Mapper: Tentacles.


Note: The sound of rushing water can be heard.


Fyrsti: Brace for impact!


Depth: Unknown. The sound of distant waterfalls is heard beneath conversation.


Mapper: Anyone else alive?


Cory: Somehow.


Fyrsti: Yeah.


Nemo and Vodq: We're alive too.


Sailor: Physically, yes. Mentally? Not sure.


Trainvoi: I think those tentacles awoke something in me.


Sailor: Where are we?


Mapper: We're close. See those ruins? They're Agarthan.


Cory: The ruins are so beautiful it's Lovecraftian; the splendor is indescribable, I can't describe it!


Fyrsti: Guys. This is cool and all, but how the hell are we getting back?


Mapper: Forget about that. Agartha's close.


Fyrsti: What about the boat?


Sailor: What boat? All I see is a pile of scrap.


Depth: Unknown. Indescribable noises, some natural and some artificial, overlap into a chorus in the background. Photo records show a ridge littered with moss-choked ruins of impossible age and geometry.


Mapper: It's there. We've made it. All we need to do... is fall.


Trainvoi: ...


Cory: It's... beautiful.


Fyrsti: Wait! Stop! If you take another step... I fear you won't be the same person coming back.


Mapper: Come on. Not now. Not when we've gotten so close. Don't take this from me!


Trainvoi: Can't you hear them Fyrsti? Can't you hear them calling?


Mapper: Let me go!


Sailor: Agartha awaits! Later losers!


Note: The sound of footsteps and rocks scraping can be heard. Photo records indicate that Sailor leapt off of the ridge to free-fall the remaining 1000m to Agartha.


Vodq: He jumped.


Depth: Unknown. The sound of song, laughter, birds and running water can be heard.


Nemo: Well, boys, we did it. We found Agartha. Is it all you wanted?


Cory: Idk how, but they have catgirls down here.


Trainvoi: how is that possible


Cory: Just suspend your disbelief ig


Sailor: We've truly become the 2028 Expedition to Agartha.


Mapper: Something feels off about this.


Vodq: Literally everything here is perfect. What's wrong?


Mapper: Remember how I traded a pistol for shelter here?


Vodq: Yeah?


Mapper: It means they've never seen a pistol before. Which means we might have doomed them by giving them the ability to kill their own.


Vodq: Don't worry about it. Just, like, enjoy the beach. And the food.


Trainvoi: And the catgirls.


Sailor: The wifi's really good down here too.


Mapper: Real. I should just chill out.


Fyrsti: Who's the guy who let us in again?


Cory: Amalteokala I think.


Nemo: How tf did you remember that name


Cory: idk


Fyrsti: Alright. When we're ready to go home, I'll ask him if we can borrow his teleporter.
